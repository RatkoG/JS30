# Kako treba da se sredi cel proekt.

## Step by step che bidi objasnato.

This is how it works...
You click a checkbox and you click another one. The first one and all to the last one get clicked. For this you have to hold down SHIFT key. This works top to bottom and bottom to top.

### Thinkgs we need to do:

1. Select evety signle one of them so we can listen when they get checked.

```javascript const checkboxes ...
```

2. Listen for clicked and call the fun.
3. We need to put the first one in variable. Cause when we hold SHIFT and check the second one. We need to know from where the first one is starting.
4. Check if they had the shift key down && check if they are checking it.
5. Loop trough every single checkbox. Look for the first one that is check. Than check every checkbox once when you see the last one stop checking them.

6. inBetween it's doing the whole thing
